        This is some boiler plate stuff to run on a bunch and see how this works in reality when It ry to format and blah blah paragraph one. 
        Hey this is the thing to do on the weekend, go up to the mountains and go runbnning and see if you see some goats that eat lichen and 
        leaves and bugs that you can also take their wool if you beat them in a one on one arm wrestling match but if you have to team up you don't

        Let’s say you are tasked with building a skit with a stranger and are only given the prompt, “you walk into a room”. Is it a bar? A ballroom? Is it a safe room?
